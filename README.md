# ASK_RS
Tiny Keyboard UI meant to play short audio samples along the C major scale as if it were a piano.

## FUNCTIONS:
Right now the program can only play wavelength frequencies through the **play_scale** function.
Each scale is declared as an array of frequencies in Hz. I plan to change this to a frequency editor and a sample library.

## DEPENDENCIES:
+ rodio: for audio management.
+ egui: minimalist GUI crate.

## TODO:
+ Implement sample loading.
+ Create UI.
+ Add Keyboard functionality.
+ Add sample gallery and save feature.

+ *(optional)* add audio layers and recordings.
+ *(optional)* add audio wave frequency editor.
